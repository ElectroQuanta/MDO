** 1
*** Problem statement
    Design a remote control with three buttons that can
remotely control the television (TV). It should be very
light, powered by batteries and controls your TV via an
infrared emitter. The TV has a built-in infrared receiver. A
button on the remote control switches the TV on/off and
will be labeled with the word "Power". The other two
buttons are used to scroll up/down and select the available
channels and they are labeled with the arrows up/down.
*** Market research
- Brief description of a remote TV control
- Bill of materials
- Unit cost
- Time to market
- Sales/Quantity of sold items anually
*** Requirements & Constraints
**** Requirements
- Remotely operated
- Low weight
- Powered by batteries
- 3 buttons:
  1) Power
  2) Up
  3) Down
- Infrared emitter response time (system output response time): 100 ms
- The TV remote may be upgraded in the future to use more buttons
**** Constraints
- Contains an infrared emitter (the TV already has an infrared receiver)
- The TV remote control must supply the required data frames imposed by the TV
  manufacturer
- Data frames may not be provided by the client
- Security concerns are defined by the data frames and the specific
  communication frequency imposed by the TV manufacturer
- 1 week deadline: 14 h
- 2 people
- Budget:
  - HW (parts acquisition and assembly): fixed costs --- 1 EUR/unit
    - TV remote Shell
    - TV remote membrane
    - LED
    - Data acquisition & Infrared emitter PCB
  - Development: project
    - 20 EUR per hour per person: 20 * 14 * 2 = 560 EUR + IVA
*** Design
**** HW specification
- Block diagram with COTS components, if possible
- List of constraints of functions to be implemented in HW or SW
  - Inclusion of a multiplexer may reduce SW burden
  - CPU peripherals:
    - PCA for wave generation
**** HW interfaces definition
- I/O ports
- HW registers
- Memory addresses for shared or I/O by memory mapping
- HW interrupts
**** SW specification: Top-down methodology
1. Identify main subsystems
   1. Signal input detector
   2. Event handler
   3. Output generator
**** SW interfaces definition
- Define the APIs in detail:
  - header files with:
    - functions prototypes
    - data structure declarations
    - class declarations
**** Start-up/shutdown process specification
**** Error handling specification
- Create error-handling routines
- Watchdog timer can be used for system recovery
**** Design verification
