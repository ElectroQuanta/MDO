\chapter{Design}
\label{ch:design}
In this section the theoretical foundations are used to design a viable
solution, accordingly to the requirements and constraints listed.
In the design phase, the product development starts, specifying the system in
terms of hardware and software and its associated interfaces, the error handling
required, and the design verification.
