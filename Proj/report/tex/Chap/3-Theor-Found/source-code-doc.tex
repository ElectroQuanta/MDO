\label{sec:source-code-docum}
Source code documentation is critical for software maintenance, specially on
large developments teams. As software applications grow in size and evolve
several modifications from base source code arise, possible with several
branches to implement different features or correct bugs. A good practice that
helps to reduce the complexity burden when interfacing and maintaining such
systems is to document the source code, making it readable and easily understood
by other people.

Source code documentation aims to describe how the code works instead of what it
does, and it is useful for the following reasons~\cite{sourceCodeDocBestPractices}:
