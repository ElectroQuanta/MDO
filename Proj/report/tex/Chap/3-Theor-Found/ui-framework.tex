\section{UI framework}
\label{sec:ui-framework}

For the development of the \texttt{Remote Client}, it is necessary to use a \gls{ui} Framework, in order to develop a \gls{ui} to the users, making it more user friendly and interactive.
There are several frameworks that can be used, such as:
%
\begin{item-c}
\item Qt;
\item Sciter;
\item Noesis GUI;
\item wxWidgets;
\item GTK+;
\item and so on.
\end{item-c}

For this project, \texttt{Qt} was chosen due to the following reasons:
\begin{item-c}
\item
  First of all, it is possible to `develop graphical user interfaces and cross-platform applications, both desktop and embedded'~\cite{qt-bib}.
The framework operates on different types of software and hardware.
Also, it has an easy-to-read code and it is possible to make an attractive
\gls{ui}.
\item 
Secondly, this framework is \texttt{cost-friendly}, not only because it has a
free license, but also because its software development takes less time to
develop due to its highly productive features.
\item
Lastly, it is implemented in C++, which means that it is possible to use many libraries.
The wide choice of modules allow the project to have rich functionality and as a result, the software will have a \gls{gui} similar to a native one.
\end{item-c}
