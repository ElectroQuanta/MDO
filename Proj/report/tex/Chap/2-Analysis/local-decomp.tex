\subsection{Local system}
\label{sec:local-system}
In this section the local system is analyzed, considering its events, use cases,
dynamic operation and the flow of events.

\subsubsection{User mockups}
\label{sec:user-mockups}
Fig.~\ref{fig:user-mockups-local} illustrates the user mockups for the local
system. It intends to mimic the user interaction with the local system,
clarifying the user actions (gestures) and the respectives responses, as well as
the workflow, comprising its four modes.

The initial state of the \gls{mdo-l}'s~\gls{ui} is depicted in thick border
outline, after a \texttt{User} has been detected --- \texttt{Interaction
  mode}. On the left it is the camera feed and on the right the commands ribbon,
containing the hints to use the system and the available options. As it can
been, the \texttt{User} can choose an option by hovering with pointing finger
over the desired option for a designated amount of time (e.g., 3 seconds).

The workflow can be as follows:
\begin{item-c}
\item If the \texttt{User} selects the \texttt{Image filter} option, the
  \texttt{Image filtering} view is shown, presenting the options to select
  filters (which can be scrolled through palm raising/lowering), to cancel or
  accept the image filter. If a filter is selected \texttt{filter1\_pressed}, it
  is applied, and if accepted it will return to \texttt{Interaction mode},
  keeping the filter on.
\item If the \texttt{User} selects the \texttt{Take Pic} option, \texttt{Picture
  mode} is started with a timer to allow the \texttt{User} to get ready before
actually taking the picture. The \texttt{User} can \texttt{Cancel} --- returning
to main menu --- or \texttt{Share} --- starting \texttt{Sharing mode}.
\item If the \texttt{User} selects the \texttt{Create GIF} option, \texttt{GIF
    mode (setup)} is started with a timer to allow the \texttt{User} to get
  ready before actually creating the \gls{gif}. After the \texttt{setup\_timer}
  is elapsed, the \texttt{GIF mode (operation)} starts, displaying a dial with
  the \gls{gif} duration until being complete. When the \texttt{gif\_timer}
  elapses, the \gls{gif} is created, enabling the \texttt{User} to
  \texttt{Cancel} --- returning to main menu --- or to \texttt{Share} ---
  starting \texttt{Sharing mode}.
\item Lastly, in the \texttt{Sharing mode}, the \texttt{User} can
  \texttt{Cancel} --- returning to main menu --- or select the
  social media network. After selecting the social media, the \texttt{User} can
  edit the post by entering its customized message and, if \texttt{Share} is
  pressed, a message box will appear displaying the status of the post sharing
  --- \texttt{Success} or \texttt{Error}.
