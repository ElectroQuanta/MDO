\chapter{Analysis}
\label{ch:analysis}
In the analysis phase, the product requirements are derived --- defining the client expectations
for the product --- as well as the project constraints --- what the environments
limits about the product. Based on the set of requirements and constraints, a
system overview is produced, capturing the main features and interactions with
the system, as well as its key components.

Finally, the theoretical foundations are outlined,
providing the basic technical knowledge to undertake the project.
