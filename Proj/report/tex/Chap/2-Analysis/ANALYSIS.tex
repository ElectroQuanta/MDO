\chapter{Analysis}
\label{ch:analysis}
In the analysis phase, the product requirements are derived --- defining the client expectations
for the product --- as well as the project constraints --- what the environment
limits about the product. Based on the set of requirements and constraints, a
system overview is produced, capturing the main features and interactions with
the system, as well as its key components.

Then, the system architecture is
devised, comprising both hardware and software domains. Next, the system is
decomposed into subsystems, presenting a deeper analysis over it, comprising its
user mock-ups, events, use cases diagram, dynamic operation and flow of events.
