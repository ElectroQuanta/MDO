\section{Requirements and Constraints}
\label{sec:req-const}

The development requirements are divided into functional and non-functional if they pertain to main functionality or secondary one, respectively. Additionally, the constraints of the project are classified as technical or non-technical.

\subsection{Functional requirements}
\label{sec:funct-requ}

\begin{item-c}
\item Take pictures and~\gls{gif}s;
\item Show advertisements through a screen and speakers;
\item Have fragrance emission;
\item Have contactless feedback through gestures recognition.
\end{item-c}
\subsection{Non-functional requirements}
\label{sec:non-funct-requ}

\begin{item-c}
\item Low power consumption;
\item Have a comfortable and non evasive interface (user-friendly);
\item Have low latency between local and remote server
\end{item-c}
\subsection{Technical constraints}
\label{sec:techn-constr}

\begin{item-c}
\item Use device drivers;
\item Use Makefiles;
\item Use C/C++;
\item Make a~\gls{cps};
\item Use Raspberry Pi as the development board;
\item Use compatible~\gls{hw} with the development board;
\item Use buildroot;
\item Work with Linux.
\end{item-c}
\subsection{Non-technical constraints}
\label{sec:non-techn-constr}

\begin{item-c}
\item Project deadline at the end of the semester;
\item Pair work flow;
\item Limited budget.
\end{item-c}

%The requirements defined the client expectations for the TV remote control,
%namely:
%\begin{item-c}
%\item Remotely operated
%\item Low weight
%\item Powered by batteries
%\item 3 buttons: Power (Off/On); Up and Down for channel selection.
%\item Infrared emitter response time (system output response time): 100 ms
%\item The TV remote may be upgraded in the future to use more buttons
%\end{item-c}

%\section{Constraints}
%\label{sec:constraints}
%The project constraints are the limitations the environment imposes on it, namely:
%\begin{item-c}
%\item the TV remote must contain an infrared emitter (the TV already has an infrared receiver)
%\item The TV remote control must supply the required data frames imposed by the TV
%  manufacturer
%\item Data frames may not be provided by the client
%\item Security concerns are defined by the data frames and the specific
%  communication frequency imposed by the TV manufacturer
%\item 1 week deadline: 14 h
%\item Manpower: 2 people
%\item Budget:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item HW (parts acquisition and assembly): fixed costs --- 1 EUR/unit (1000
%    batch production)
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item TV remote Shell
%    \item TV remote membrane
%    \item Data acquisition \& Infrared emitter PCB
%    \end{itemize}
%  \item Development: project --- 20 EUR per hour per person, totalling 560 EUR +
%    IVA
%  \end{itemize}
%\end{item-c}
