%The requirements defined the client expectations for the TV remote control,
%namely:
%\begin{item-c}
%\item Remotely operated
%\item Low weight
%\item Powered by batteries
%\item 3 buttons: Power (Off/On); Up and Down for channel selection.
%\item Infrared emitter response time (system output response time): 100 ms
%\item The TV remote may be upgraded in the future to use more buttons
%\end{item-c}

%\section{Constraints}
%\label{sec:constraints}
%The project constraints are the limitations the environment imposes on it, namely:
%\begin{item-c}
%\item the TV remote must contain an infrared emitter (the TV already has an infrared receiver)
%\item The TV remote control must supply the required data frames imposed by the TV
%  manufacturer
%\item Data frames may not be provided by the client
%\item Security concerns are defined by the data frames and the specific
%  communication frequency imposed by the TV manufacturer
%\item 1 week deadline: 14 h
%\item Manpower: 2 people
%\item Budget:
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item HW (parts acquisition and assembly): fixed costs --- 1 EUR/unit (1000
%    batch production)
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item TV remote Shell
%    \item TV remote membrane
%    \item Data acquisition \& Infrared emitter PCB
%    \end{itemize}
%  \item Development: project --- 20 EUR per hour per person, totalling 560 EUR +
%    IVA
%  \end{itemize}
%\end{item-c}
