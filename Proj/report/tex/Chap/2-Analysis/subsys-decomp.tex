\section{Subsystem decomposition}
\label{sec:subsyst-decomp}
In this section the system is decomposed into subsystems and, for each
subsystem, a more detailed analysis is performed yielding its user mock-ups,
events, use case diagram, dynamic operation and the flow of events throughout
the subsystem.

As aforementioned, the subsystems identified are: \texttt{Remote Client}
(\gls{mdo-rc}), \texttt{Remote Server} (\gls{mdo-rs}), and \texttt{Local System} (\gls{mdo-l}).
