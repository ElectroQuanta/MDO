\section{Project goals}%
\label{sec:project-goals}
The project aims to develop a \gls{cps} for multi-sensory marketing with
contactless user interaction. The key goals identified and the respective path
to attain them are:
\begin{enum-c}
\item \emph{devise a device with audio and video outputs, as well as fragrance
    diffusion}: understand audio and video streaming and study fragrance
  nebulizer technologies.
\item \emph{create a contactless user interface based on gestures through
    computer vision}: identify user gestures through computer vision and match them to interface
  callbacks; a virtual keyboard may be required for user input.
\item \emph{devise a distributed architecture to convey brand advertisement
  information to the local device}: understand distributed architectures and
apply them for optimal data flow; create a remote client-server model to convey
information from the brands to the device through remote cloud database
services; devise adequate data frames to convey information to the local device;
create a local server to respond to the remote server requests.
\item \emph{apply facial recognition to the camera feed and subsequently apply
  image filters specific to each brand}: understand facial recognition
algorithms and apply them to the camera feed; apply image filters on top of the
identified faces through a specialized \gls{api}.
\item \emph{enable image and GIFs sharing to social media for increased brand
    awareness}: understand how to use social media APIs for media sharing.
\end{enum-c}
