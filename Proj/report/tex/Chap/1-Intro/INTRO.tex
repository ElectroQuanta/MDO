The present work illustrates the application of the two first stages of the Waterfall methodology
--- Analysis and Design --- to develop a \gls{tv} remote control. This type of project
begins with the establishment of a contract between the client (Samsung company)
and the project team, clearly defining the problem statement and deriving the
product requirements and constraints associated to the project. It should be
noted, however, that both roles are played out by the authors.
A market
research is performed to gain more insight over this market and the
product placement, and the product overall characteristics.

In the analysis
phase, the product requirements are derived --- defining the client expectations
for the product --- as well as the project constraints --- what the environments
limits about the product. Finally, the theoretical foundations are outlined,
providing the basic technical knowledge to undertake the project.

In the design phase, the product development starts, specifying the system in
terms of hardware and software and its associated interfaces, the error handling
required, and the design verification.
