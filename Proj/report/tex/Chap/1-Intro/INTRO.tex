% CHAPTER - Introduction -------------------------
\chapter{Introduction}%
\label{ch:introduction}
The present work, within the scope of the Embedded Systems course, consists in
the project of a \gls{cps}, i.e., a system that provides
seamless integration between the cyber and physical worlds~\cite{TaoCPS}. The
Waterfall methodology is used for the project development, providing a
systematic approach to problem solving and paving the way for project's success.

In this chapter are presented the project's context and
motivation, the problem statement --- clearly defining the problem, the market
research --- defining the product's market share and opportunities, the project goals, the project planning and the document outline.
%
%The present work illustrates the application of the project meant to do for the course of Embedded Systems, required from the professors from \gls{esrg}.
%This type of project begins with the establishment of what type of prototype do the students propose to do, followed for its implementation. This implementation needs to follow all the steps of the Waterfall Model in order to give students the capability to work the best way possible, either in group or in solo.
%
%It should be noted, however, that there are some requirements and constraints gave by the professors which means that not everything is decided by the students. 
%To have the capability of bypass them is one of the main characteristics of attending and working in engineering.
