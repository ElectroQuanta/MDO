\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:prob-stat}
The first step of the project is to clearly define the problem, as a result of
the contract established between the client and the project team, yielding, in
this case, the following project statement:

``Design a remote control with three buttons that can
remotely control the television (TV). It should be very
light, powered by batteries and controls your TV via an
infrared emitter. The TV has a built-in infrared receiver. A
button on the remote control switches the TV on/off and
will be labeled with the word "Power". The other two
buttons are used to scroll up/down and select the available
channels and they are labeled with the arrows up/down.''
