\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}
In the implementation phase, the solution developed in the various domains is
implemented into the target platforms, accordingly to the system design
specification. In this chapter is presented the implementation for the various
domains and subsystems identified, namely the \texttt{Remote Client},
\texttt{Remote Server} and
\texttt{Local System}.

\section{Deployment}
\label{sec:deployment}
As aforementioned the implementation of the Local System was performed and
tested on the host before cross-compiling and deploying to the target embedded
system.

However, and even though a successful target system image was obtained, the deployment was not possible as the cross-compiling revealed itself
more complicated due to the dependency on external libraries.

Nonetheless, as the application logic was successfully validated, the deployment
task resides only on the successful cross-compiling which could not be attended
due to time restrictions.
