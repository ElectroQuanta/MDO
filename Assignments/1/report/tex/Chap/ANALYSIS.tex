\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:requirements}
- Remotely operated
- Low weight
- Powered by batteries
- 3 buttons:
  1) Power
  2) Up
  3) Down
- Infrared emitter response time (system output response time): 100 ms
- The TV remote may be upgraded in the future to use more buttons

\section{Constraints}
\label{sec:constraints}
- Contains an infrared emitter (the TV already has an infrared receiver)
- The TV remote control must supply the required data frames imposed by the TV
  manufacturer
- Data frames may not be provided by the client
- Security concerns are defined by the data frames and the specific
  communication frequency imposed by the TV manufacturer
- 1 week deadline: 14 h
- 2 people
- Budget:
  - HW (parts acquisition and assembly): fixed costs --- 1 EUR/unit
    - TV remote Shell
    - TV remote membrane
    - LED
    - Data acquisition \& Infrared emitter PCB
  - Development: project
    - 20 EUR per hour per person: 20 * 14 * 2 = 560 EUR + IVA
