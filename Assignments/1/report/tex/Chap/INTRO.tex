\section{Problem statement}

infrared emitter. The TV has a built-in infrared receiver. A
button on the remote control switches the TV on/off and
will be labeled with the word "Power". The other two
buttons are used to scroll up/down and select the available
channels and they are labeled with the arrows up/down.
