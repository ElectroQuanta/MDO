\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:prob-stat}
    Design a remote control with three buttons that can
remotely control the television (TV). It should be very
light, powered by batteries and controls your TV via an
infrared emitter. The TV has a built-in infrared receiver. A
button on the remote control switches the TV on/off and
will be labeled with the word "Power". The other two
buttons are used to scroll up/down and select the available
channels and they are labeled with the arrows up/down.

TV remotes are composed by the TV remote Shell,
the TV remote membrane, one LED and a data acquisition \& Infrared emitter PCB.

The unit cost of universal TV Remotes is about 3 to 5 euros
